# Learning Python standard libraries by creating examples.

## py_roller.py

- Library: `argparse` to parse Command Line arguments and optional keyword arguments
- Usage: `py_roller.py 20 2 --old_timey` 
- Essentially, you're asking the program to roll a 20 sided die 2 times and print out the results in an old-timey diction. Perhaps you play Dungeons and Dragons and will find this useful.
